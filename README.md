# Excel Portfolio Projects: A Learning Journey in MS Excel

Welcome to my personal collection of Excel projects. This repo is built as part of my ongoing journey to master Microsoft Excel, from core skills to advanced tools. These projects reflect real things I’ve explored and built as I’ve deepened my understanding of Excel’s capabilities.

So far, I’ve worked with automation through VBA, and I’m continuing to expand into areas like dashboards, data visualizations, financial models, and advanced reporting.

Through each one, I’ve discovered just how powerful Excel can be — not just as a spreadsheet tool, but as a platform for problem-solving, analysis, and automation.
